    <h1>Optimization Toy — Delft Hyperloop</h1>
    <p class="muted">My role, system overview, and key subsystems</p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>
      For nearly a year, I held the position of <strong>Chief Engineer</strong> at Delft Hyperloop. Around December,
      I also assumed the planning and execution responsibilities from our project manager, who was temporarily
      unable to continue in his role.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this combined capacity, I was responsible for both the <strong>technical direction</strong> and
      <strong>project coordination</strong> of the team. My main tasks included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defining technical objectives and requirements</strong> — from high-level system goals down to detailed component specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinating work across departments</strong>, ensuring alignment of parameters, design interfaces, and dependencies between subsystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Leading planning and execution</strong> across different time horizons:
        <ul>
          <li>long-term (annual roadmap and milestones),</li>
          <li>medium-term (project phases), and</li>
          <li>short-term (daily operational priorities).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Overseeing design quality</strong>, production, and testing processes to ensure consistency and technical excellence.</li>
      <li><strong>Managing cross-functional communication</strong>, monitoring interfaces between technical teams to prevent integration issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Leading departmental leads</strong> at a strategic level while also <strong>supervising the daily operations</strong> of the testing team later in the year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This role required a balance of <strong>strategic oversight</strong> and <strong>hands-on technical leadership</strong>,
      as well as close collaboration with multiple engineering disciplines to deliver a cohesive and high-performing prototype.
    </p>

    <h2>System and Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      Delft Hyperloop is a team that each year develops a new hyperloop prototype from the ground up to set new
      records and compete in international challenges. In my year, we set a goal of carrying out a
      <strong>first levitating lane switch without moving elements</strong> — a crucial step toward a scalable and
      low-maintenance hyperloop network. This design enabled maximum throughput while eliminating the wear and
      reliability challenges associated with moving track components.

    <h2>Levitation, Propulsion and Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The pod achieved <strong>full electromagnetic levitation</strong>, even during lane switching and turning maneuvers.
      Vertical stability was provided by four <strong>Hybrid Electromagnetic Suspension (HEMS)</strong> units, while lateral
      guidance was maintained through four <strong>Electromagnetic Suspension (EMS)</strong> actuators that dynamically
      balanced forces to keep the pod centered within millimeter precision. Propulsion was delivered by a
      <strong>Linear Flux Switching Permanent Magnet (LFSPM)</strong> motor — an efficient, track-passive design that enabled
      acceleration up to <strong>1&nbsp;m/s²</strong>. The lightweight <strong>rectangular ladder-frame chassis</strong> integrated both
      the propulsion and braking systems, with symmetrical brakes mounted near the vertical beams to ensure
      optimal stability.

    <h2>Thermal Management, Control Systems and Powertrain</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure vacuum compatibility and sustained performance, the pod incorporated a <strong>water-based thermal
      management system</strong> that extracted heat from the motor drives and vacuum enclosure and dissipated it through
      <strong>evaporative cooling</strong>. We achieved <strong>high-precision localization</strong>, accurate to <strong>3&nbsp;mm</strong>, using a scalable
      strip-laser system, while levitation sensors maintained positioning within <strong>±10&nbsp;µm</strong>. A set of safety and
      communication PCBs continuously monitored pod health, activating braking in case of faults, and constant
      telemetry ensured reliable communication with the ground station. The team additionally developed fully custom
      <strong>high- and low-voltage batteries</strong> as well as the <strong>power distribution boards</strong>.
